 1-  Provide comments and documentation: Without comments and documentation, 
      it can be challenging for other developers to understand the code's purpose and behavior.
      Adding comments and documentation can help make the code more accessible and easier to maintain.

  2-Use more descriptive method and variable names 
     -the datatype private String op: which keyword op cant describe what does it mean 
    -the getType() method name is vague and can be misleading.. Consider renaming it to something like getPropertyType() to better reflect its functionality.
    -The getShowAll() method name  could be more descriptive ..Consider renaming it to something like isShowAllEnabled() to make its purpose more clear.
     The current method and variable names do not provide much information about their purpose or functionality.
     Using more descriptive names can make the code more readable and easier to understand.
  
 

  3-Avoid using null values: The getType(), getValues(), and getDefault() methods return null if the ApplicationProperty object is null. This can lead to runtime errors if the calling code does not handle null values correctly.
    Consider using optional or default values instead of null to make the code more predictable.
    
  4-Validate input parameters: The setSessions() method does not validate the input array's contents, leading to potential runtime errors. Adding input validation can help prevent runtime errors and make the code more robust.
     For example, you could check to ensure that each element in the array is not null before assigning the value.
    public void setSessions(Long[] sessions) {
    if (sessions != null) {
        for (Long session : sessions) {
            if (session == null) {
                throw new IllegalArgumentException("Session array contains null elements.");
            }
        }
    }

  5-Encapsulation: The showAll field is public and can be accessed directly. It's generally better to encapsulate fields by making them private and providing getter and setter methods,
    as this can help maintain the object's state and prevent unexpected behavior.
  
  6-String concatenation: The getValues() method concatenates strings using the + operator inside a loop. This can be inefficient for large arrays or loops and create many temporary objects in memory.
    A more efficient approach would be to use a StringBuilder to concatenate the strings.

  7-Use a switch statement: Instead of using multiple if statements, a switch statement can help make the code more concise and easier to read.
